1. Code the included design into valid HTML/CSS
2. The resume links should go to your own github pages site(ex: devarispbrown.github.io). You'll be creating your resume at that page later.
3. When you hover over the profile picture, it should show a link to your previously created video. Please upload your videos into the ./videos folder.
